# Jevil-and-Miku-Deltarune-Fangame
I am making a fangame of Deltarune using Kristal Engine.

The current version (0.0.7) contains:
1. 3 early concept of an area
2. 2 types of enemies
- Retlutte
- Tem Flakes
3. 3 different bosses
- Jevil
- Jevil (weird route)
- Deck
4. 1 shop
- Seam's shop
5. handfull of cutscenes!
6. and the ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ORIGINAL STARWALKER

upcoming changes:
1. 6 whole areas
2. A lot of new enemies
3. 3 bosses (not counting the weird route)
4. fun minigames
5. even more cutscenes
6. and more of the ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ORIGINAL STARWALKER
Right now the only way to play this is by downoloading all the Kristal stuff and if you want to play it without downloading all the stuff, you'll need to wait for the demo version.

If you wanna play it in this early state you'll need to download Kristal here's the ling -> https://kristal.cc/wiki/downloading

"these 0.0.7 versions are‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ pissing ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎me off" - ORIGINAL STARWALKER (probably)
